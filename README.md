# Homebridge Plug-In for Frigidaire Dehumidifier
An Homebridge plug-in to integrate the Frigidaire's connected dehumidifier with HomeKit. It monitors and control devices via the Frigidaire unofficial cloud API. Thanks to the Frigidaire Python API  https://github.com/bm1549/frigidaire developers and https://github.com/karlg100/frigidaire , this module uses logic and code gain from reviewing those works.
Frigidaire updated their API (to V3) in June 2023 and deprecated v2 in February 2024, meaning the plug-in engine had to be re-written. Upgrade to version 2+ may impact previous automation or setting. This is a one time event to support Frigidaire v3 API.



## Limitation:
* This module will poll for the status of the various components based frequency provided in the configuration file. No realtime notification is provided.

## ðŸ’§ Note: Dehumidifier Relative Humidity

There is a difference between Frigidaire App and Homebridge/HomeKit for relative humidity. 

HomeKit Relative Humidity work between 0%-100% (By design). Here is translation between Frigidaire and Homekit.

| Frigidaire | HomeKit |
| --- | --- |
| 35% | 0% |
| 40% | 10% |
| 45% | 20% |
| 50% | 30% |
| 55% | 40% |
| 60% | 50% |
| 65% | 60% |
| 70% | 70% |
| 75% | 80% |
| 80% | 90% |
| 85% | 100% |


Example configuration is below, with Frigidaire dehumidifier mode set to <i>Quiet</i> mode for dehumidifying and Air purifier/Ionizer set to display in Homekit.
